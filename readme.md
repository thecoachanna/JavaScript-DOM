# JS DOM Practice

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.

## JS DOM Practice

Practice getting elements from the DOM using the common methods for interacting
with the DOM!

For each of these you should store the result in a variable and `console.log` it
see if you got it right.

## 1. `getElement(s)By`

The first set of DOM getters we'll talk about are the `getElement(s)By` methods,
like `getElementById`. Open up `getelements.js` and work through the prompts.

## 2. `querySelector`

The second set of DOM getters we'll talk about are `querySelector` and
`querySelectorAll`. Comment out `getelements.js` in `index.html` and uncomment
`queryselector.js`. Then open up `queryselector.js` and work through the
prompts.

## 3. Updating DOM Content

Use the following methods of DOM nodes to update the content of the DOM:

* `innerHTML`
* `outerHTML`
* `innerText`
* `outerText`
* `textContent`

## 4. Working with the `classList` API

The following are the three methods we can use to work with classes on a DOM
node:

1. `.classList.add()`
1. `.classList.remove()`
1. `.classList.toggle()`

## 5. Working with `data-*` Attributes

Use the `data-*` attribute to add data to a DOM node. You can get that data in
JavaScript with a node's `dataset` property.
